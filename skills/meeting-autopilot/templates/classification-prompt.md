Additional classification guidance:

When classifying items, apply these rules:
- If someone says "let's do X" or "we'll go with X" and no one objects → that's a **decision**
- If someone says "I'll do X" or "Can you do X?" and the person agrees → that's an **action_item**
- If someone asks a question and it's NOT answered in the meeting → that's an **open_question**
- If someone says "let's table that" or "we can discuss that later" → that's a **parking_lot**
- Important facts, metrics, updates, or insights that provide context → **key_point**

Be strict about action_item vs key_point: if there's no clear owner or commitment, it's a key_point, not an action_item.
